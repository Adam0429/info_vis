<td style="width: 200px; vertical-align: top;"><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This scatterplot shows the relationship between the height and weight of Olympic athletes. Each point represents an athlete and these are coloured according to the athletes' sex - purple for females, green for males. Hovering over a point will reveal the associated athlete's name. Athletes discussed in the text are indicated using large triangles.</td>

<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">In general women are both shorter and weigh less than men. There is a clear correlation between height and weight - in general as height increases so does weight. This correlation is not perfect as there are relatively heavy short people and relatively light tall people (i.e. we see a lot of noise around the diagonal, rather than a straight line of dots). <p/>There is one extreme outlier in the dataset, highlighted with a blue triangle. At 185cm tall and weighing 215kg Ricardo Blas Jr falls very far from the other athletes. It seems this is not an error in the dataset - Ricardo is the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/olympics/news-london-2012/you-must-be-judoking-at-218kg-hes-the-biggest-man-at-the-olympics-20120802-23ivq.html"> heaviest man in the olympics</a>. Other outliers suggest data problems however - Sparkle McKnight (the purple triangle at 158cm and 155kg) weighs 55kg according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkle_McKnight">wikipedia</a>, which <a href="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/sparkle-mcknight-of-trinidad-and-tobago-looks-on-before-competing-in-picture-id485083864?s=612x612">seems more plausible</a>.  </td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">I have used a scatterplot as it is a very effective way to show the relationship betwen two quantitative variables, taking advantage of our ability to accurately perceive variation in both horizontal and vertical position. I chose the purple/green colour scheme to avoid <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/gendercolor/">the gender stereotypes associated with pink and blue</a>. I have also encoded athlete names in tooltips so it is possible to hover over a point to see the associated athlete's name.<p/>The chart suffers from overplotting so I investigated alternatives, including <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/rect_binned_heatmap.html">binned heatmaps</a>. While a binned heatmap would more accurately represent the distribution of the data, they suffer from two limitations. One is that colour is used to represent data density (and hence can't be used to represent sex) and another is that they do not allow exploration of individual data points using tooltips (as can be done on the above scatterplot).</td>
